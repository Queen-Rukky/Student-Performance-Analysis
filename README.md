# 🎓 Student Performance Analysis (Excel)


## 🧠 Project Overview

The **Student Performance Analysis Dashboard** is a comprehensive, interactive Excel-based data analysis project aimed at uncovering the various factors that influence academic performance among students. It leverages real-world educational metrics such as attendance, exam scores, sleep hours, tutoring sessions, and parental involvement to provide actionable insights for improving student outcomes.

## 🎓 Student Performance Analysis Dashboard 

This dashboard was developed to assist **educators, school administrators, policy-makers, and educational researchers** in making data-driven decisions. By using intuitive visualizations and interactive filters, it reveals trends and correlations that are often overlooked in raw data tables.

## 🎯 Objectives

- To explore the impact of behavioral and socio-economic factors on students' academic performance.
- To visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) for quick and effective decision-making.
- To allow dynamic filtering and comparison across multiple demographic and performance metrics.
- To provide a reliable, easily interpretable dashboard tool that can guide intervention strategies.

## 📊 Dashboard Features

### ✅ Key Performance Indicators

- **Average Previous Score**: `76.29%`  
- **Average Exam Score**: `66.13%`  
- **Average Tutoring Sessions**: `1.46 sessions/student`

### 📈 Data Visualizations

- **Gender vs Score**: Compares performance between male and female students.
- **School/Teacher Quality vs Score**: Analyzes score distribution based on perceived school/teacher quality.
- **Parental Involvement vs Score**: Evaluates how student performance is affected by parental involvement.
- **Access to Resources vs Score**: Investigates the role of material and digital resources on learning outcomes.
- **Attendance Table**: Displays student attendance in relation to other academic factors.

### 🔍 Interactive Filters (Slicers)

Users can dynamically explore data across several dimensions:

- **Family Income** (`High`, `Low`)
- **Tutoring Sessions** (`0-2`, `3-5`, `6-8`)
- **Sleep Hours** (`<4`, `4-5`, `6-7`)
- **Hours Studied**
- **Internet Access**

## 💡 Insights and Analysis

- **Tutoring Matters**: Students with more consistent tutoring support scored significantly higher in both exam and previous academic assessments.
- **Sleep Balance Is Crucial**: Students sleeping between **6–7 hours** consistently performed better than those sleeping too little or too much.
- **Parental Involvement is a Game-Changer**: Where parents are actively involved in the learning process, students tend to have significantly better outcomes.
- **Gender Trends**: Male students slightly outperform female students in this dataset, but variance is visible depending on sleep and tutoring access.
- **Resource Paradox**: Interestingly, students with **medium access to educational resources** outperformed both those with high and low access, possibly indicating more efficient use of what they have.

## 🧩 Tools Used

- **Microsoft Excel**: The dashboard was developed entirely in Excel using:
  - PivotTables and PivotCharts
  - Conditional Formatting
  - Slicers for interactive filtering
  - Custom color themes (yellow-black) for visual clarity
